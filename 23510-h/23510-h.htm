    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The county of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was an old Colonial county, and even
      as late as the time of my story contained many Colonial relics. Among them
      were the court-house and the jail, and, at that time, the Judge and the
      Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-house was an old brick edifice of solemn and grayish brown, with
      a portico whose mighty columns might have stood before a temple of Minerva
      overlooking the Ã†gean Sea. With its thick walls and massive barred
      windows, it might have been thought the jail, until one saw the jail. The
      jail once seen stood alone. A cube of stone, each block huge enough to
      have come from the Pyramid of Cheops; the windows, or rather the
      apertures, were small square openings, crossed and recrossed with great
      bars of wrought iron, so massive that they might have been fashioned on
      the forge of the Cyclops. Looking through them from the outside, one saw
      just deep enough into the narrow cavern to see another iron grating, and
      catch a suspicion of the darkness beyond. The entrance was but a slit
      letting into a stone-paved corridor on which opened the grinding iron
      doors of the four small cells, each door a grate of huge iron bars,
      heavily crossed, with openings just large enough to admit a hand. The jail
      was built, not to meet the sentimental or any other requirements of a
      reasonable and humane age, but in that hard time when crime was reckoned
      crime, when the very names of &ldquo;gaol&rdquo; and &ldquo;prison&rdquo; stood for something
      clear and unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge of the circuit was himself a relic of the past, for his youth
      had been cast among those great ones of the earth whose memory had come
      down coupled with deeds so heroic and far-reaching, that even to the next
      generation the actors appeared half enveloped and magnified in the halo of
      tradition. His life had been one of high rectitude and dignity, to which
      habits of unusual studiousness and a great work on Executors had added a
      reputation for vast learning, and in his old age both in his manner and
      his habit he preserved a distance and a dignity of demeanor which lent
      dignity to the Bar, and surrounded him wherever he went with a feeling
      akin to awe. Though he had given up the queue and short clothes, he still
      retained ruffles, or what was so closely akin to them that the difference
      could scarcely be discerned. Tall, grave, and with a little bend, not in
      the shoulders but in the neck; with white hair just long enough to be
      brushed behind in a way to suggest the knot which had once appeared at the
      back; with calm, quiet eyes under bushy white eyebrows; a face of pinkish
      red inherited from Saxon ancestors, who once lived in the sun and on the
      brine, and a mouth and chin which bespoke decision and self-respect in
      every line and wrinkle, wherever he moved he produced an impression of one
      who had survived from a preceding age. Moreover, he was a man of heroic
      ideals, of Spartan simplicity, and of inflexible discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had a weakness it was his susceptibility to feminine testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The county was a secluded one&mdash;a fitting field for such a judge. And
      the great meetings of the year were the sessions of the Circuit Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge's name was then on every lip, and his passage to the court-house
      was a procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone except those unfortunates who had come under his ban, or might be
      too far gone in drink to venture into his presence, drew up along the path
      from the tavern to bow to him and receive his courteous bow in return as
      he passed with slow and thoughtful step along, preceded by the Sheriff and
      his deputies, and followed by the Bar and &ldquo;the multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever he entered the court or rose from the bench the lawyers stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was impressive off the bench, on the bench he was imposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At heart one of the kindest of men, he added to great natural dignity a
      high sense of the loft-iness of a position on the bench and preserved,
      with impartial and inflexible rigor, the strictest order in his court,
      ruling bar and attendants alike up to a high accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one would any more have thought of taking a liberty with Judge Lomax
      than he would have done it with an old lion. Just one man, possibly, might
      have thought of it, but he would not have done it&mdash;and this was Aleck
      Thompson, the Sheriff of the county, a jovial man past middle age, a
      rubicund bachelor, who had courted half the girls in the county and was
      intimate with more than half the people in the circuit. He was daring even
      to rashness. He had held the office of Sheriff&mdash;not so long, perhaps,
      as the Judge had sat on the bench, but, at least, since he first stood for
      the place; and he could hold it as long as he wished it. He was easily the
      most popular man in the county. He treated everybody with unvarying
      joviality and indiscriminate generosity, and it was known that his income,
      though large, was, except so much as was absolutely necessary for his
      support, distributed with impartial fairness among the people of his
      county, a part over the poker-table, a part over the bar, and the balance
      in other popular ways. He had a face that no one could read, and bluffed
      as well with a pair of treys as with four aces. But he used to say that
      such a bluff was to be used rarely, and only on important occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then some opposition to him would arise and a small headway would
      be made against him. As, for instance, after he advised Squire Jefford's
      plump and comely daughter, Mary, not to marry Dick Creel, because Dick was
      too dissipated. There were some who said that the Sheriff had designs
      himself on Sam Jefford's buxom, black-eyed daughter, while others held
      that he was afraid of young Dick, who was an amiable and popular young
      fellow, and that he did not want him to get too much influence in the
      lower end of the county. However it was, Mary Jefford not only married her
      young lover, but sobered him, and as she was young, pretty, and ambitious,
      and worshipped her husband, Dick Creel at the next election, to use the
      vernacular, &ldquo;made cornsideruble show runnin' ag'inst the Sheriff, and give
      him cornsideruble trouble.&rdquo; Still, Thompson was elected overwhelmingly,
      and few people believed Mary Creel's charge that the Sheriff had got Dick
      drunk on purpose to beat him. Thompson said, &ldquo;Did n't anybody have to <i>git</i>
      Dick drunk&mdash;the work was t'other way.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The session of the Circuit Court in the &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; year of the
      Commonwealth,&rdquo; as the writs ran, and &ldquo;in the sixteenth year of Aleck
      Thompson's Sheriffalty,&rdquo; as that official used to say, was more than
      usually important. The noted case of &ldquo;<i>Dolittle et al. vs. Dolittle's
      Executrix</i>&rdquo; was tried at the autumn term of the court, and caused
      considerable excitement in the county; for, in addition to the amount of
      property and the nice questions of law which were involved, the two sides
      had been severally espoused by two sister churches, and nearly half the
      county was in attendance, either as witnesses or interested spectators.
      Not only was every available corner in the little village filled to
      overflowing with parties, witnesses, and their adherents, but during the
      first week of the term the stable yards and road-sides were lined with
      covered wagons and other vehicles, in or under which some of those who had
      not been fortunate enough to obtain shelter in the inn used to sleep, and
      &ldquo;Briles's bar&rdquo; under the tavern did a thriving business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the case, however, wore on, and the weather became inclement, the crowd
      dropped off somewhat, though a sufficient number still remained to give an
      air of life to the little roadside village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain of these visitors found the bar-room on the ground floor of the
      tavern across the road more attractive than the court-room, and as evening
      came the loud talking in that direction told that the visits had not been
      fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect order, however, prevailed in the court, until one evening one of
      these visitors, a young man named Turkle, who had been spending the
      afternoon at the bar, made his way into the court-room. He was clad in a
      dingy, weather-stained overcoat and an old slouch hat. He sank into a seat
      at the end of a bench near the door and, being very drunk, soon began to
      talk aloud to those about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; called the Sheriff over the heads of the crowd from his desk in
      front, and those near the man cautioned him to stop talking. A moment
      later, however, he began again. Again the Sheriff roared &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; But by
      this time the hot air of the court-room had warmed up Mr. Turkle, and in
      answer to the warning of those about him, he declared in a maudlin tone,
      that he &ldquo;Warn't goin' to keep silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got 's much right to talk 's anyone, and I'ma goin' to talk 's much 's
      I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friends tried to silence him, and the Sheriff made his way through the
      crowd and endeavored to induce him to leave the court-room. But it was to
      no purpose. Jim Turkle was much too &ldquo;far gone&rdquo; to know what he was doing,
      though he was in a delightfully good humor. He merely hugged the Sheriff
      and laughed drunkenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aleck, you jist go 'way f'om here. I ain't a-goin' to shet up. You shet
      up yourself. I 'm a-goin' to talk all I please. Now, you hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as if to atone for his rudeness, he caught the Sheriff roughly by the
      arm and pulled him toward him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aleck, how 's the case goin'? Is Mandy a goin' to win? Is that old rascal
      rulin' right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff urged something in a low voice, but Turkle would not be
      silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you see thar,&rdquo; he broke out with a laugh to those about him, &ldquo;did n't
      I tell you Aleck wa' n 't nothin' but a' ol' drunkard? What d' you s'pose
      the ol' rascal wants me to do? He wants me to go over there to the bar and
      git drunk like 'im, and I ain't goin' to do it. I never drink. I 've come
      here to see that my cousin Mandy's chil'ern gits their patrimony, and I
      ain' a goin' to 'sociate with these here drunken fellows like Aleck
      Thompson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff made a final effort. He spoke positively, but Turkle would not
      heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, 'Judge' be damned! You and I know that ol' fellow loves a dram jest
      's well 's the best of 'em&mdash;jest 's well 's you do. Look at his face.
      You think he got that drinkin' well-water! Bet yer he 's got a bottle in
      's pocket right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A titter ran through the crowd, but was suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quiet voice was heard from the other end of the court-room, and a
      deathly silence fell on the assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspend for a moment, gentlemen, if you please. Mr. Sheriff, bring that
      person to the bar of the Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd parted as if by magic, and the Sheriff led his drunken
      constituent to the bar, where his befuddled brain took in just enough of
      the situation to make him quiet enough. The Judge bent his sternest look
      on him until he quailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no more sense of propriety than to disturb a court of justice in
      the exercise of its high function?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turkle, however, was too drunk to understand this. He tried to steady
      himself against the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't is-turbed no Court of function, and anybody 't says so, Jedge, iz
      a liar.&rdquo; He dragged his hand across his mouth and tried to look around
      upon the crowd with an air of drunken triumph, but he staggered and would
      have fallen had not the Sheriff caught and supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge's eyes had never left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff, take this intoxicated creature and confine him in the county
      gaol until the expiration of the term. The very existence of a court of
      justice depends upon the observance of order. Order must be preserved and
      the dignity of the Court maintained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir&mdash;half of horror&mdash;throughout the court-room. Put
      a man in that jail just for being tight!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Sheriff on one side and his deputy on the other, led the culprit
      out, now sufficiently quiet and half whimpering. A considerable portion of
      the crowd followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the prisoner was sober enough, and he begged hard to be let off
      and allowed to go home. His friends, too, joined in his petition and
      promised to guarantee that he would not come back again during the term of
      court. But the Sheriff was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The Judge told me to put you in jail and I 'm goin' to do it.&rdquo; He
      took two huge iron keys from his deputy and rattled them fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turkle shrank back with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't goin' to put me in thar, Aleck! Not in that hole! Not just for
      a little drop o' whiskey. It was <i>your</i> whiskey, too, Aleck. I was
      drinkin' yo' health, Aleck. You know I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge won't know anything about it. He 'll never think of it again,&rdquo;
       pleaded several of Turkle's friends. &ldquo;You know he has ordered a drunken
      man put there before and never said any more about it&mdash;just told you
      to discharge him next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turkle stiffened up with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Aleck.&rdquo; He leaned on the Sheriff's arm heavily. &ldquo;He 's drunk himself&mdash;I
      don't mean that, I mean <i>you 're</i> drunk&mdash;oh, no&mdash;I mean <i>I'm</i>
      drunk. Everybody 's drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you 've gone and called me a drunkard before the Court. Now I 'm
      goin' to show you.&rdquo; Thompson rattled his big keys again savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turkle caught him with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aleck, don't talk that a-way,&rdquo; he pleaded in a tremulous voice.
      &ldquo;Don't talk that a-way!&rdquo; He burst into tears and flung his arms around the
      Sheriff's neck. He protested that he had never, seen him take a drink in
      his life; he would go and tell the Judge so; if necessary, he would swear
      to it on a Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aleck, you know I love you better than anybody in this world&mdash;except
      my wife and children. Yes, better than them&mdash;better than Jinny. Jinny
      will tell you that herself. Oh! Aleck!&rdquo; He clung to him and sobbed!
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends indorsed this and declared that they would bring him back if
      the Judge demanded his presence. They would &ldquo;promise to bring him back
      dead or alive at any time he sent for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Turkle and his friends were always warm supporters of the Sheriff, a
      fact of which they did not fail to remind him, Thompson was not averse to
      letting him off, especially as he felt tolerably sure that the Judge
      would, as they said, forget all about the matter, or, if he remembered it,
      would, as he had done before, simply order him to discharge the prisoner.
      So, after dragging the culprit to the jail door to scare him well and make
      his clemency the more impressive, he turned him over to the others on
      condition that he would mount his mule and go straight home and not come
      back again during the term. This Turkle was so glad to do that he struck
      out at once for the stable at what Thompson called a &ldquo;turkey trot,&rdquo; and
      five minutes later he was galloping down the road, swinging mightily on
      his sorrel mule, but whipping for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Thompson was much toasted about the court-house for his
      humanity. Several of his admirers, indeed, got into somewhat the same
      condition that Turkle had been in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Dick Creel, who had come to court that day, lapsed from virtue and
      fell a victim to the general hilarity.

      The next morning when court was opened, the Judge was even more than
      usually dignified and formal. The customary routine of the morning was
      gone through with; the orders of the day before were read and were signed
      by the Judge with more than wonted solemnity. The Clerk, a
      benignant-looking old man with a red face and a white beard, took up his
      book and adjusted his glasses to call the pending docket: the case of &ldquo;<i>Dolittle
      vs. Dolittle's Ex'ex.</i>,&rdquo; and the array of counsel drew their chairs up
      to the bar and prepared for the work of the day, when the Judge, taking
      off his spectacles, turned to the Sheriff's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff, bring in that unfortunate inebriate whom I sentenced to
      confinement in the gaol yesterday. The Court, while sensible of the
      imperative necessity of protecting itself from all unseemly disorder and
      preserving its dignity undiminished, nevertheless always leans to the side
      of mercy. The Court trusts that a night's incarceration may have
      sufficiently sobered and chastened the poor creature. The Court will
      therefore give him a brief admonition and will then discharge him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge sat back in his large arm-chair and waited benignantly with his
      gaze resting placidly in front of him, while a deathly silence fell on the
      crowd and every eye in the courthouse was turned on the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson, standing at his desk, was staring at the Judge with jaw dropped
      and a dazed look like a man who had suddenly to face judgment. He opened
      his lips twice as if to speak, then turned and went slowly out of the
      court-house like a man in a dream, while those left behind looked in each
      other's eyes, some half scared and others more than half amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, Thompson stopped just between two of the great pillars. He rammed
      his hands deep in his pockets and gazed vacantly over the court-green and
      up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will he do with you! Remove you!&rdquo; asked two or three friends who had
      slipped out of the door behind him and now stood about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'll put me in jail&mdash;<i>and</i> remove me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter if he says black 's white and white 's black, don't you open
      your mouth or you 'll get it. It 's much as I can do to keep you out of
      jail this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sheriff&mdash;! But, Aleck&mdash;! Just wait a minute! I don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant he was inside the courthouse and the Sheriff was marching
      him up the aisle between the upturned faces. He planted him at the bar
      immediately before the Court, pulling off his hat in such a way as to drag
      his hair over his face and give him an even more dishevelled appearance
      than before. Then he moved around to his own desk, keeping his eye fixed
      piercingly on the astonished Creel's bewildered face. A gasp went over the
      court-room, and the Bar stared at the prisoner in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge alone appeared oblivious of his presence. He had sat absolutely
      silent and motionless since he had given the order to the Sheriff to
      produce the prisoner, his face expressive of deep reflection. Now he
      withdrew his eye from the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With impressive deliberation he put on his large gold-rimmed spectacles;
      sat up in his chair; assumed his most judicial expression, which sat
      curiously on his benignant face, and looked severely down upon the
      culprit. The court-room shivered and Thompson's round face grew
      perceptibly whiter; but his eyes, after a single glance darted at the
      Judge, never left the face of the man at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next second the Judge began to speak, and Thompson, and the court-room
      with him, heaved a deep sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;you have committed an act of grievous
      impropriety. You have been guilty of one of the most reprehensible
      offences that any citizen of a Commonwealth founded upon order and justice
      could commit, an act of such flagrant culpability that the Court, in the
      maintenance of its dignity and in the interest of the Commonwealth found
      it necessary to visit upon you punishment of great severity and
      incarcerate you in the gaol usually reserved for the most depraved
      malefactors. Intemperance is one of the most debasing of vices. It impairs
      the intellect and undermines the constitution. To the inhibition of Holy
      Writ is added the cumulative if inferential prohibition of the Law, which
      declines to consider inebriety, though extreme enough in degree to impair
      if not destroy the reasoning faculty, in mitigation of crime of the
      highest&mdash;&mdash; dignity. If you had no beloved family to whom your
      conduct would be an affliction, yet you have a duty to yourself and to the
      Commonwealth which you have flagrantly violated. To shocking inebriety you
      added the even grosser misdemeanor of disturbing a Court in the exercise
      of its supreme function: the calm, orderly, and deliberate administration
      of justice between the citizens of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Judge&mdash;?&rdquo; began the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp cough from the Sheriff interrupted him and he glanced at the
      Sheriff to meet a menacing shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangeness of the scene and the impressive solemnity of the Judge so
      wrought upon the young man that he began to whimper. He looked at the
      Judge and once more opened his mouth to speak, but the Sheriff, called,
      sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Creel glanced appealingly from the Judge to the Sheriff, only to meet
      another imperative shake of the latter's head and a warning scowl. Then
      the Judge proceeded, in a tone that showed that he was not insensible to
      his altered manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Court, always mindful of that mercy whose quality 'is not strained,
      but droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath,'
      trusts that your recent incarceration, though brief, may prove adequate to
      the exigencies of the occasion. It hopes that the incarceration of one
      night in the common gaol may prove in case of a young man like yourself
      sufficiently efficacious to deter you from the repetition of so grave a
      misdemeanor, and at the same time not crush too much that generous spirit
      of youth which in its proper exercise may prove so advantageous to its
      possessor, and redound so much to the benefit of the Commonwealth. The
      order of the Court, therefore, is that the Sheriff discharge you from
      further imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff, conduct the young man to the door, caution him against a
      recurrence of his offence, and direct him toward his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will now proceed to call the docket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court-room with another gasp broke into a buzz, which was instantly
      quelled by the sharp command of the Sheriff for silence and order in the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Judge&mdash;&rdquo; began Creel again, &ldquo;I don't understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he did not understand was not heard, for Thompson seized the prisoner
      before he could finish his sentence, and, with a grip of steel on his arm,
      hustled him down the aisle and out of the court-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many persons poured out of the court-room after them and with
      subdued laughter followed the Sheriff and his charge across the green.
      Thompson, however, did not wait for them. The young man appeared inclined
      to argue. But the Sheriff gave him no time. Hurrying him down the walk, he
      unhitched his horse for him and ordered him to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sheriff&mdash;Mr. Thompson, I 'm darned if I understand what it is
      all about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were drunk,&rdquo; said Thompson&mdash;&ldquo;flagrantly inebriated. Go home. Did
      n't you hear the Judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard him. He 's doty. I might have been drunk, but I 'm darned if
      I slept in jail last night&mdash;I slept in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm darned if you did n't,&rdquo; said the Sheriff. &ldquo;The Judge has ruled it
      so, and so you did. Now go home and don't you come back here again during
      this term, or you will sleep in jail again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old Judge is doty,&rdquo; declared the young man with a tone of
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for you if you come back here. Go home now, just as
      quick as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Creel reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it beats my time. I 'll tell you what I 'll do, Mr. Thompson,&rdquo; he
      said, half pleadingly. &ldquo;I 'll go home and stay there if you will promise
      not to tell my wife I was in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; said Aleck, solemnly. &ldquo;I give you my word I won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what 's more,&rdquo; continued Creel, &ldquo;if you 'll keep anybody else from
      doing it, I 'll vote for you next time for Sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you that, too,&rdquo; said Aleck, &ldquo;and if anybody says you were
      there, let me know, and I 'll come up there and&mdash;and tell her you
      were n't. I can't do any more than that, can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't do any more than that,&rdquo; admitted Creel, sadly, and, leaning
      over and shaking hands with the Sheriff cordially for the first time in
      some years, he rode away in profound dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I 've got to face Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I reckon I might as well do
      it. Whiskey is a queer thing. I must have been a lot drunker than I
      thought I was, because if the Court had n't ruled it, I would have sworn I
      slept in that there wing room last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that 's the best bluff I ever put up,&rdquo; said Thompson to the throng
      about him as he turned back to the court-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff's bluff became the topic of the rest of the term. Such
      audacity, such resourcefulness had never been known. Thompson became more
      popular than ever, and his re-election the following spring was admitted
      to be certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Aleck Thompson 's the smartest man that is,&rdquo; declared one of his
      delighted adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thompson himself thought so, too, and his imitation of the Judge, of Dick
      Creel, and of himself in court became his most popular story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the old Judge moved among the throng of tittering laymen calm,
      dignified, and unsuspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever he gets hold of you, Aleck,&rdquo; said one of that worthy's
      worshippers, &ldquo;there 's likely to be a vacancy in the office of sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'll put me in jail,&rdquo; laughed Aleck. &ldquo;Dick Creel says he 's kind o'
      doty.&rdquo;

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Court was nearing the end of the term, <i>Dolittle et al. vs.
      Dolittle's Executrix</i>, with all its witnesses and all its bitternesses,
      had resulted in a mistrial, and the sister churches were wider apart than
      ever. The rest of the docket was being daily disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff was busy one day telling his story to an admiring throng on
      the court-green when someone casually observed that Mrs. Dick Creel had
      got off the train that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff's face changed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waitin' in the tavern parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she doing here! What is she doing in there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest a settin' and a waitin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'spect she is waitin' for you, Aleck!&rdquo; hazarded one of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a burst of laughter, for Squire Jefford's daughter, Mary, was
      known to be &ldquo;a woman of her own head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff laughed, too; but his laughter was not as mirthful as usual.
      He made an ineffectual attempt to keep up his jollity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I 'll go and see Mary,&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the group with affected cheerfulness, but his heart was heavier
      than he liked to admit. He made his way to the &ldquo;ladies' parlor,&rdquo; as the
      little sitting-room in the south wing of the rambling old tavern,
      overlooking the court-green was called, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of the wood fire, in a stiff, high-backed chair sat a young
      woman, in her hat and wrap and gloves, &ldquo;jest a settin' and a waitin'.&rdquo; She
      was a well-made and comely young woman under thirty, with a ruddy face,
      smooth hair and bright eyes that the Sheriff knew could both smile and
      snap. Her head was well set on rather plump shoulders; her mouth was well
      formed, but was now close drawn, and her chin was strong enough to show
      firmness&mdash;too much firmness, as Thompson mentally decided when he
      caught its profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff advanced with an amiable smile. He was so surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you here, Mary! When did you come?&rdquo; His tone was affable and even
      testified pleasure. But Mary did not unbend. She was as stiff as the chair
      she sat in. Without turning her head she turned her eyes and looked at him
      sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mrs. Creel</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a glint in her black eyes that meant war, and Thompson's
      countenance fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-ur-Mrs. Creel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't know as you 'd know me!&rdquo; She spoke quietly, her eyes still on
      him sidewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know you! Why, of course, I know you. I don't forget the pretty girls&mdash;leastways,
      the prettiest girl in the county. Your father and I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you made a mistake about my husband and Jim Turkle. I thought
      maybe you might think I was <i>Mrs</i>. Turkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the least perceptible lifting of her shoulders and drawing down
      of her mouth, but quite enough to suggest Jenny Turkle 's high shoulders
      and grim face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff tried to lighten the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Come now, Mary, you must n't get mad about that. It was all a joke. I
      was comin' right up after court adjourned to tell you about it&mdash;and&mdash;.
      It was the funniest thing! You 'd 'a' died laughing if you 'd been here
      and seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard they was all laughin' about it. <i>I</i> ain't so easy to amuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Yes, you would, too,&rdquo; began Thompson, cajolingly. &ldquo;If you 'd seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time does Court adjourn!&rdquo; she asked, quietly and irrelevantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not for two or three&mdash;not for <i>several</i> days yet&mdash;Probably
      't will hold over till well into next week. But if you 'd seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what time does it let out <i>to-day?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thompson's face fell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;ah&mdash;about&mdash;ah&mdash;Why! What do you want to know
      for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the Judge.&rdquo; Her voice was dead level.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Co'te</i> business,&rdquo; with cold irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that you 're goin' to&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused without framing the rest of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly stood up and flamed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am&mdash;that 's just what I am goin' to do. That 's what I 've
      come here for. You may take a liberty with the Judge&mdash;he 's doty; but
      you can't take a liberty with <i>me</i>&mdash;I 'm Squire Jefford's
      daughter, and I 'm goin' to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was facing him now, and her black eyes were darting fire. Thompson was
      quite staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mary! I am surprised at you. Your father's old friend&mdash;who has
      had you on his knee many a time. I am shocked and surprised&mdash;and
      mortified and&mdash;astonished&mdash;and mortified&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 've done said that one once,&rdquo; she said, icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mary, I thought we were friends&mdash;&rdquo; he began. But she cut in on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; She spoke with contempt. &ldquo;You 've had it in for Dick ever since
      he was a boy.&rdquo; Her voice suddenly broke and the tears sprang to her eyes
      and rolled down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mary&mdash;no such thing&mdash;I assure you&mdash;Dick and I are the
      best of friends&mdash;<i>dear</i> friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sniff was more forcible than words. She wiped her eyes and looked at
      him with freezing contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm a fool! And I don't want you to be <i>Mary</i>-in' me, either. If
      Dick chooses to let you get him drunk and make a beast and a fool of him
      and drag him up before the Court like a&mdash;a&mdash;like that drunkard,
      Jim Turkle, what don't know how to behave himself seemly in Court, and
      Circuit Court at that&mdash;he may; but I 'll let you know, <i>I'm</i> not
      goin' to do it. I don't mean the Judge to think my husband's a thing like
      that. I mean to set him right. And I 'll tell him you are nothing but an
      old gambler who spends your time ruinin' young men, and braggin' as how
      you can bluff anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary!&mdash;ur&mdash;Mrs. Creel!&rdquo; gasped the Sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stalked by him wiping her eyes, and marched straight to the door; but
      the Sheriff was too quick for her. His office, his reputation, everything
      hung on his pacifying her. He sprang to the door and, standing with his
      back against it, began to apologize in so humble a tone that even the
      angry wife could not but listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said everything that any mortal could have said, and declared that he
      would do anything on earth that she might ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected, and he began to hope again. When their eyes met, hers were
      still hard, but they were calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you think you are making a fool of me,&rdquo; she began, and then as he
      protested she shut him up with a sharp gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do, you think so; but you are not. There is but one thing I will
      accept in apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to make Dick your deputy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would n't. Stand aside.&rdquo; She gave a sweep of the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside, I say&mdash;I 'd rather have you removed anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mary, just listen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside, or I will call.&rdquo; She straightened herself and looked past
      him, as if listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mary, do be reasonable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her mouth as if to cry out. The Sheriff threw up both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, please&mdash;For kingdom's sake, don't! What unreasonable creatures
      women are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'd better let women alone. One is as much as you can manage now.&rdquo; She
      spoke witheringly. &ldquo;I give you one more chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than I can manage. You know Dick will get drunk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you make him. Who was drunk at that barbecue at Jones's Cross
      Roads last summer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who set up till after Sunday mornin' playin' kyards&mdash;. Yes, <i>gamblin''</i>
      the last night of last County Cote!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mary!&mdash;All right. I lay down my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew paper and pencil from her little bag and held them out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't my word good enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean to do it, why are you afraid to write it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then write it.&rdquo; She held the paper to him with outstretched arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I write!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write what I say: 'I Aleck Thompson, promise and bind myself if I remain
      in office for another term to appoint my <i>dear</i> friend, Dick Creel'&mdash;underscore
      that&mdash;'my first deputy, and to keep him in as long as he keeps sober
      and attends to his business.' Now sign it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What consideration do I get for this!&rdquo; Thompson looked up from the paper
      at her ca-jolingly. She met his gaze with a little flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgot the consideration,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I Squire Jefford's
      daughter, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write: 'The consideration for the above is the love I bear the aforesaid
      Richard Creel, and the fear I have that his wife will tell the Judge what
      a smart Aleck I am.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, you don't want me to write that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them very words. I little more forgot the consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I want a witness. I see the court is broken up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tain't necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a witness, and I 'm goin' to <i>have</i> him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm goin' to have him. You come and introduce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, are you after all goin' to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met his gaze frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;unless you go back on me. If you do, I 'll tell him and show him
      the paper; and what 's more, I 'll show it all around this county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of genuine admiration sprang into the Sheriff's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, you ought to have been a man, or&mdash;Mrs. Aleck Thompson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper was signed and witnessed.
